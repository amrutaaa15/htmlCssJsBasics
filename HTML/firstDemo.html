        <h3>Self</h3>
        <p><b>Virat Kohli </b>(Hindustani: [ʋɪˈraːʈ ˈkoːɦliː] (About this soundlisten); born 5 November 1988) is an Indian cricketer and the current captain of the India national team. A right-handed top-order batsman, Kohli is regarded as one of the best contemporary batsmen in the world.[3] He plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL) as captain of the franchise since 2013.
