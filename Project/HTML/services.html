                businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development
                commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison,
                client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce

                technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of
                a designated department. There are three kinds of web developer specialization: front-end developer,
                back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and
                visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.</p>

                easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft
                Visual Studio. Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is still
                required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly.</p>

            <p class="scolor">Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>

            <p class="bcolor">AngularJs Development </p>
            <p class="scolor">AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework for developing single-page applications. It is maintained mainly by Google and a community of individuals and corporations. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in web applications and progressive web applications.

                AngularJS is used as the frontend of the MEAN stack, consisting of MongoDB database, Express.js web application server framework, AngularJS itself (or Angular), and Node.js server runtime environment.
                
                The AngularJS framework is on Long Term Support ("LTS") until December 31, 2021.[3][4] After that date Google will no longer update AngularJS to fix security, browser compatibility, or jQuery issues.[5][4] The Angular team recommends upgrading to Angular (v2+) as the best path forward, but they also provided some other options.[6]</p>

            <p class="scolor">Vue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. The core library is focused on the view layer only.[13] Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages.[14]

                Vue.js allows for extending HTML with HTML attributes called directives.[15] The directives offer functionality to HTML applications, and come as either built-in or user defined directives.</p>

            <p class="bcolor">TypeScript</p>
            <p class="scolor">TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.[5] As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.

                TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js or Deno). There are multiple options available for transcompilation. Either the default TypeScript Checker can be used,[6] or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.
                
                TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files. This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js basic modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript.</p>
